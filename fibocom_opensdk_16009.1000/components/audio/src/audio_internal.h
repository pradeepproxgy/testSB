 * \brief get the mutex used in audio device
 *
 * It is weird, and it is a concept deeply bound with current design. Audio
 * application will run on single thread, and it will call API of audio
 * application. Such as, audio player API will be called in audio thread when
 * data is requested. Single mutex can avoid mutual lock.
 *
 * Mutal lock may occur when audio application uses separated mutex.
 *
